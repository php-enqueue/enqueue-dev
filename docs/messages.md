## Pull request to readonly repo.

Thanks for your pull request! We love contributions.

However, this repository is what we call a "subtree split": a read-only copy of one directory of the main enqueue-dev repository. It is used by Composer to allow developers to depend on specific Enqueue package.

If you want to contribute, you should instead open a pull request on the main repository:

https://github.com/php-enqueue/enqueue-dev

Read the contribution guide

https://github.com/php-enqueue/enqueue-dev/blob/master/docs/contribution.md

Thank you for your contribution!
