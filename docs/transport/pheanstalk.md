The transport uses [Pheanstalk](https://github.com/pda/pheanstalk) library internally.

## Installation

```bash
$ composer require enqueue/pheanstalk
```


## Create context

```php
<?php
use Enqueue\Pheanstalk\PheanstalkConnectionFactory;

// connects to localhost:11300
$factory = new PheanstalkConnectionFactory();

// same as above
$factory = new PheanstalkConnectionFactory('beanstalk:');

// connects to example host and port 5555
$factory = new PheanstalkConnectionFactory('beanstalk://example:5555');

// same as above but configured by array
$factory = new PheanstalkConnectionFactory([
    'host' => 'example',
    'port' => 5555
]);

$context = $factory->createContext();

// if you have enqueue/enqueue library installed you can use a factory to build context from DSN 
$context = (new \Enqueue\ConnectionFactoryFactory())->create('beanstalk:')->createContext();
```

## Send message to topic

```php
<?php
/** @var \Enqueue\Pheanstalk\PheanstalkContext $context */

$fooTopic = $context->createTopic('aTopic');
$message = $context->createMessage('Hello world!');

$context->createProducer()->send($fooTopic, $message);
```

## Send message to queue 

```php
<?php
/** @var \Enqueue\Pheanstalk\PheanstalkContext $context */

$fooQueue = $context->createQueue('aQueue');
$message = $context->createMessage('Hello world!');

$context->createProducer()->send($fooQueue, $message);
```

## Consume message:

```php
<?php
/** @var \Enqueue\Pheanstalk\PheanstalkContext $context */

$fooQueue = $context->createQueue('aQueue');
$consumer = $context->createConsumer($fooQueue);

$message = $consumer->receive(2000); // wait for 2 seconds

$message = $consumer->receiveNoWait(); // fetch message or return null immediately 

// process a message

$consumer->acknowledge($message);
// $consumer->reject($message);
```
